# HADRON
HADRON is my first iteration of a 16 DOF bipedal humanoid robot. The focus of this project is on the controls and programming for bipedal locomotion and multiple DOF balance compensation.

The 3D design of HADRON is not my design. It was found from Thingiverse here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:356398. 

However, the sensor & actuator selection, supporting electronics and programming are all my original design.

The documentation for HADRON is not available anymore and the Thingiverse post is not in English, so my goal is to design this robot from the reference photos and STL's provided and document my progress along the way. Without further ado, let's get into it!

<b> Hardware </b>

<i> 3D Printed Parts </i>

- x2 Chest Plates
- x2 Feet
- x2 Hands
- x10 Assembly Brackets
- x14 Servo Brackets
- x14 Servo Joints

All of these parts can be printed with PLA filament and about 15-20 % infill density. They came out really nice and I was able to use a cool split color (blue/red) filament for the frontal chest piece. See pictures below.
