# HADRON
HADRON is my first iteration of a 16 DOF bipedal humanoid robot. The focus of this project is on the controls and programming for bipedal locomotion and multiple DOF balance compensation.

The 3D design of HADRON is not my design. It was found from Thingiverse here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:356398. However, the sensor & actuator selection, supporting electronics and programming are all my original design.

The documentation for HADRON is not great, so my goal is to design this robot from the reference photos and STL's provided and document my progress along the way. Let's get into it!
